# FowlEditor
Very, and we mean VERY, barebones editor for FowlEngine ðŸ˜¬

## Compiling
To compile, you need PySide6 and Python 3.12. Once you have Python, run in your terminal `pip3 install pyside6`, then run in the editor directory `python main.py`. Then you should see an open folder window visible.
